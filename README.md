# Lloyd's algorithm
This notebook contains the solution to a task from the "Mining Massive Data" course in 2022S at the University of Vienna. It includes an implementations of K-Means clustering with Lloyd's algorithm as well as a comparison to scipy's cluster labels, predefined cluster labels and a visualization of the algorithm's convergence. The dataset can be found on [here](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2004/Data).
